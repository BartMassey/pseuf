Done when
* write documentation
* investigate and fix markdown buglet: Drupal
  at least needs underbars backslashed
* fix latex buglet: last entry in tabbing environment should
  not have a line terminator.
* fix buglet: extra blank lines in output should be
  protected by comments or omitted.
* figure out what to do about bad markdown interactions,
  e.g. numbering, constructs like H[k](v), etc
* investigate and fix markdown bug: starting with a blank
  line causes everything to come out bold; c.f. blank lines
  above

Soon
* add superscript and subscript support
* add controlled indentation support
* add per-backend arguments
* add LaTeX "math-first" option
* add BMP greek support option

Maybe someday
* add start and end directives for filter mode
* add include directive
* get special symbols from include file
* add direct HTML backend
* real hash tables
